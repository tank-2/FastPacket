# FastPacket
A small but powerfull network packet processing tool

##What is it?
This is a simple tool that allows you to interact with serialized network packets in a named tuple form. This makes your code more pythonic because the data type and purpose is explicit in your programming. It also allows for rapid development of protocols by exposing a simple dictionary based data format for defining packet structures.
